**Assignment for the Children's Department of the Catharina Hospital**

Develop 'THE RUBE WALL': an Interactive Digital Rube Goldberg Machine

Most children at the children's department of the Catharina Hospital in Eindhoven are bored. It is therefore important that children and patients can do something fun or exciting during their stay. In the playroom of the hospital, the hospital management, together with Fontys students, wants to develop a first version of a digital interactive wall. It has been decided to base the wall on the 'Rube-Goldberg principle'. This principle should encourage young patients to play, build and have fun. In addition, children can use their creativity.

For the test set-up, it was initially decided to use a number of screens. 
This setup ensures that the different sections flow smoothly as a good RGM should. 
Each screen is linked to a laptop and showing a section.
